# chadaClock

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project demonstrates using the computer clock to create a user adjusted clock tool. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think my version does a good job keeping time while the user is interacting with the tool.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think making a cooler menu interface is one of the ways to improve this project.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The discussion board was a great resource for me when I was stuck in this project. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The ability to interact with the system clock is a huge benefit for coding. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program easy to understand by keeping it packaged in one file and by commenting thoroughly.
